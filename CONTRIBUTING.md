# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributing A Patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshiayush/inb/issues).
2. Please don't mix more than one logical change per submittal, because it makes the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.
3. Also, coordinate with team members that are listed on the issue in question. This ensures that work isn't being duplicated and communicating your plan early also generally leads to better patches.
4. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes.
5. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style. See [.pylintrc](https://github.com/joshiayush/inb/blob/master/.pylintrc) in the root directory.
6. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
7. Submit a pull request.

## Style

To keep the source consistent, readable, diffable and easy to merge, we use a fairly rigid coding style, as defined by the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
